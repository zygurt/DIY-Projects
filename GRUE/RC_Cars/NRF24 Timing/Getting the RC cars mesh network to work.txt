RC car install Readme
Install bcm2835 from http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html
cd bcm2835-1.xx
./configure
make
sudo make check
sudo make install

Go to http://tmrh20.github.io/RF24Mesh/Setup-Config.html
Download the 3 Software Requirements and unzip

For installing using SPIDEV
Install RF24 first by doing this:

Make sure that spi device support is enabled and /dev/spidev<a>.<b> is present
Install RF24, using SPIDEV
./configure --driver=SPIDEV
sudo make install -B

Install Network stuff by
cd ../RF24Network
sudo make install

Then install the NRF24 Mesh stuff by navigating to that folder and:
cd ../RF24Mesh
sudo make install

cd examples_RPi
make
sudo ./RF24Mesh_Example_Master (This will check that it runs)


Once that runs it's time to get our stuff working.
Connect the nRF module to the Raspberry Pi using the pin assignments found
at tmrh20.github.io/RF24/RPi.html

Replace the RF24Mesh_Example_Master.cpp file with the one in the google drive.
Copy across the audio files

run make again to compile our car racing program.
sudo ./RF24Mesh_Example_Master (To run our program)

For the cars, the arduino source code is found on the google drive.
The car number needs to be either 1 or 2.  The server receives these numbers and
uses them for triggering which car is crossing the finish line.
Modify the car number before uploading.


For setting up the RC cars,
Install Arduino if you don't already have it.
sudo apt-get install arduino (For raspberry pi)
Install the RF24, RF24Network and RF24Mesh libraries for arduino
On a Raspberry pi, the easiest thing to do is to unzip the previous RF24 downloads into /home/pi/sketchbook/libraries
and then restart arduino
Use the ino file on google drive.
This shouldn't need to be done, unless we upgrade the arduinos, or kill the current ones.


Finally, there is a bash script which makes it easy to run everything.
Currently called Elympics.sh it does the following:
cd ~/RF24Mesh/examples_RPi
echo "Time to Race"
echo "The GRUE E-Olympics"
sudo ./RF24Mesh_Example_Master


echo "All over red rover"

Assuming that RF24Mesh is in the home directory, it will call the race control program.




TODO - Allow for more than 2 cars
